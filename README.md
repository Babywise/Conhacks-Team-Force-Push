## Project Idea

[Insert a detailed description of your project idea here. Explain the problem you are solving, the target audience, and the unique value proposition of your solution. For example:]

> Our project aims to tackle food waste by creating a platform that connects consumers with local businesses offering surplus food at discounted prices. This not only reduces waste but also promotes sustainable consumption practices. The platform includes features such as real-time inventory tracking, user reviews, and gamification to encourage participation.
